# Welcome to GRCMana | Where GRC Minds Meet

> WORK IN PROGRESS

## üëã Hi, I'm Harry and Welcome To GRCMana
Over the course of nearly two decades, I have helped technologists, security professionals and business leaders from all walks of life reduce cost, improve security and drive business success by unlocking the power of GRC.

# Here's What I've Learnt

> The world of Governance, Risk, and Compliance is shifting faster than ever.

1. **The rules keep changing - and fast** - New frameworks. New threats. New expectations. GRC isn‚Äôt static anymore ‚Äî and knowing what ‚Äúgood‚Äù looks like is harder than ever.
2. **Manual processes can't keep up** - As risks evolve and business moves faster, legacy tools and spreadsheets are slowing you down. Staying compliant shouldn‚Äôt feel like a full-time fire drill.
3. **You're expected to lead - without support** - GRC roles are expanding. But training, mentorship, and peer insight haven‚Äôt caught up. Too often, you‚Äôre left to figure it out alone.
